# Food Manager App

## Introduction

The **Food Manager** is a smart food management application designed to help reduce food waste. Our app addresses common issues such as forgetting expiration dates, buying excessive food, and improper food storage methods. By tracking food usage, monitoring expiration dates, generating grocery lists, and optimizing recipes based on available ingredients, Food Manager makes food management easier and more efficient.

## Features

- **Easy Food Entry**: Add food items to the app via text input or speech recognition, along with their expiration dates.
- **Expiration Notifications**: Receive notifications when your food items are about to expire.
- **Food Tracking**: Maintain a list of expiring and consumed food, helping you manage your inventory effectively.
- **Smart Grocery Lists**: Generate optimized grocery lists based on the contents of your refrigerator.
- **Recipe Suggestions**: Get recipe suggestions that utilize the items in your fridge, reducing waste.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple, small-sized, and optimized app with a clean and minimalistic design.

## How to Use

1. **Adding Food Items**: You can add food items by manually typing them in or using the speech recognition feature. Make sure to enter the expiration date accurately.
2. **Checking Expiration Dates**: The app will display a list of foods that are nearing their expiration date and will notify you when an item is about to expire.
3. **Managing Your Inventory**: Track what food you have consumed, and update the list accordingly.
4. **Generating Grocery Lists**: Use the app to generate a smart grocery list that optimizes your shopping by suggesting items you need while reducing food waste.
5. **Recipe Suggestions**: Find new ways to use the food you have on hand by exploring recipe suggestions.

## Heuristic Evaluation

The app was evaluated using Nielsen’s 10 usability heuristics, and the following improvements were identified:

1. **Visibility of System Status**: Improved visibility of system status by displaying the page heading as a status indicator.
2. **Real-World Match**: Improved iconography and language to better align with real-world conventions.
3. **User Control and Freedom**: Added an undo/redo feature and a delete option for food items.
4. **Error Prevention**: Implemented error messages to prevent users from selecting invalid dates.
5. **Recognition vs. Recall**: Commonly used food items are now stored, so users don’t have to recall them repeatedly.
6. **Flexibility and Efficiency**: Introduced a recommendation system for similar food items.
7. **Aesthetic Design**: The color palette was optimized to match the app’s minimalist aesthetic.
8. **Help and Documentation**: A help page was added, including FAQs and contact information.
